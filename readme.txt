We never inject ads into your site!
Using the unique **errnio** plugin maximizes your full engagement and monetization potential on mobile web with no banners or taking any more of your site real-estate. **Swipy** senses finger gesture actions users perform, and offers up your content gallery upon a certain swipe left command.
